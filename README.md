[RRS Presentation Youtube Link](https://youtu.be/44Z2FIjhTtU)

This project is known as Restaurant Reservation System (RRS), which is a web-based application for a restaurant.The overall purpose of this RRS is basically to create and develop a restaurant reservation system for both customers and restaurateur.  RRS allows customers to reserve their table based on their specific date and time which they can also update the reservation. In the RRS, both customers and restaurateur can view reservation in order to ease the reservation that already been made by the customers. Both customers and restaurateur can also cancel the reservation that has been made.We manage to implement some of the crucial parts learned in the class such as the usage of primefaces to develop the user interface for the restaurant reservation system. We also learned on how to use and developing the RRS that includes JSP. On top of that, we do provide a third party component which is maps. We hope to develop a system that ease all the end-users.
