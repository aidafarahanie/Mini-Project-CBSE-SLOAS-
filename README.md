This project is known as Restaurant Reservation System (RRS), which is a web-based application for a restaurant.The overall purpose of this RRS is basically to create and develop a restaurant reservation system for both customers and restaurateur.  RRS allows customers to reserve their table based on their specific date and time which they can also update the reservation. In the RRS, both customers and restaurateur can view reservation in order to ease the reservation that already been made by the customers. Both customers and restaurateur can also cancel the reservation that has been made.

We manage to implement some of the crucial parts learned in the class such as the usage of primefaces to develop the user interface for the restaurant reservation system. We also learned on how to use jsf and primefaces framework for the ui. We are using glassfish server 4.1 as the application. It is because the server is embedded with the netbeans ide. as for the db we are using javaDB also knows as java derby database. It is because javaDB embedded in the netbeans ide. 

On top of that, we do provide a third party component which is maps. The maps is use to show the location of the restaurant and user can directly use it with the google maps for navigation purpose. We hope to develop a system that ease all the end-users.
