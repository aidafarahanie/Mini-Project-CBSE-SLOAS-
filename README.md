# Restaurant Reservation System

The overall purpose of this RRS is basically to create and develop a table reservation system for both customers and restaurateur. This RRS project is a web-based application for a restaurant. RRS allows customers to reserve their table based on their specific date and time which they can also update the reservation. From this RRS, the customers can view the menu available in the restaurant. In the RRS, both customers and restaurateur can view reservation in order to ease the reservation that already been made by the customers. Both customers and restaurateur can also cancel the reservation that has been made.We manage to implement some of the crucial parts learned in the class such as the usage of primefaces to develop the user interface for the restaurant reservation system (RRS). We also learned on how to use and developing the RRS that includes JSP. On top of that, we hope to develop a system that ease all the end-users.
