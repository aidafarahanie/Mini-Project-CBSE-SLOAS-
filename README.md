# Student-Lecturer Online Appointment System (SLOAS)
Mini project cbse
SLOAS is an online appointment system between students and their lecturers. An appointment scheduling system within a university is a very good idea, as it minimizes time usage not only for the students and lecturers, but the university staffers. In the past, these appointment processes were done   manually   and, because   of   this, there   were   many instances	of overbooking or forgetting	to cancel an appointment which could free up the space to   schedule another in its place.  To eliminate human error due to setting appointments manually, a system will be developed to make the scheduling process easier
